This is the source code for a [web application](https://evanmunro.shinyapps.io/peptide-checker-app/) that wraps a [C++ program](https://github.com/evanmunro/peptide-checker) written by the author for troubleshooting solid state peptide synthesis, so that those without C++ or command line knowledge can use the code. It contains one extra feature from the C++ utility, which is the ability to specify position specific protecting groups that adjust the mass of specific amino acids.
